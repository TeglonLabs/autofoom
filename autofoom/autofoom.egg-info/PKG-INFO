# AUTOFOOM
by vie mccoy, jessica taylor, and evan mcmullen for morpheus systems

autofoom is a program that allows you automatically navigate the latent space of base models.

instructions to use the lui:

make sure you have uv installed and a .env file with your openai and hyperbolic api keys (in the autofoom directory)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TeglonLabs/autofoom.git

cd autofoom

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

lui
```

environment setup:

create a `.env` file in ./autofoom with the following variables:

```env
HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY=your_hyperbolic_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
CLASSIFIER_MY_CUSTOM_MODEL=model_id
```

the custom classifiers are optional and only point to openai fine tunes. you can train the classifer on whatever you want as long as it only outputs a score.
